# USER STORY
### When I want to volunteer in Los Angeles, 
	* I go to the Appenders website
### When I enter the website I see an input bar where I can put in my zip code and choose a distance from zipcode (1 - 5 miles)

### When I enter the website I see checkboxes on the side that say categories of volunteering

## The categories I see are:
	* Animal Shelters
	* Education
	* Homelessness 
	* Hunger
	* Environment
### When I check off certain boxes and submit my zip code

## Then I see 5-10 volunteering organizations that are:
	* Related to my checked boxes
	* Within my zipcode and distance
### Each result is
	* A card that includes
	* Address
	* Abstract about volunteering opportunity
	* Link to opportunity or signup page
	* A save button 
		* When I click on the save button
		* The vol. opportunity gets placed in a side column of activities I am interested in.
		* The opportunity stays there when I refresh the page
```
